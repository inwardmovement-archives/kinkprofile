### How to use it?

- Fill in your **name**, **kinks** and **preferences**.
- Sort by ascending **Score** and hide the Score column.

### About
Google Sheet is used as a compromise between features, UX and DX in regards to the simplicity of the project.

The approach is opt-in and personalized: we do not provide a list of predetermined kinks. Should you need inspiration, you may have a look at Wikipedia's [List of paraphilias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paraphilias).

Any suggestions? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/inwardmovement/kinkprofile/issues/new) on GitHub.
